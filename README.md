Will play a varity of games (ie chess, checkers, connect4, tictaktoe, etc)
that can all be played/solved (as appropriate) by utilizing a min-max tree

This means that the driver and "AI" can be used regardless of the game being played, the only
differences will be in the move generation and the evaluation functions (which will be handled within
the game client)




REFACTOR!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Code is a mess right now



To do:

	Design driver
	Make dummy classes
	Implement:
		tic-tak-toe
		connect4
		checkers
		chess

	threading
	Networking	
	Get doxygen working

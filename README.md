Will play a varity of games (ie chess, checkers, connect4, tictaktoe, etc)
that can all be played/solved (as appropriate) by utilizing a min-max tree

This means that the driver and "AI" can be used regardless of the game being played, the only
differences will be in the move generation and the evaluation functions (which will be handled within
the game client)
